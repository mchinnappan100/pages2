*   **"The moon looks adorable"**
*   "Let me look into your eyes."
*   "Let me live a million times in one breath."
*   "I don't know when and how I fell in love."
*   "The moon."
*   "My Lord has granted my wish."
*   "I have found my eternal partner."
*   "You are my queen, I'll take care of you."
*   "My sweet musk."
*   "Even the darkness is upset of this luminous night."
*   "The innocent devotees called out in prayer, arranging the sacred seats at the door."
*   "Garland of flowers, the holy vermillion."
*   "Let's go to the house of the Lord."
*   "With gold and silver, the idol was adorned, The procession lit up, all around."
*   "I came to your place with 'langar'."
*   "The anklets around my feet tinkle"
*   "My heart races when I see my beloved."
*   "Waiting, though barriers have been set in my way"
*   "Longing, as measures have been crossed at the doorway"
*   "This starry night, I see this starry night in you."
