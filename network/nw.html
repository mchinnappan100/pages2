                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    Network routing is the backbone of the internet, enabling seamless communication between devices across the globe. It determines the optimal path for data packets to travel from a source to a destination, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery. This whitepaper explores how users connect to the internet, the mechanics of routing, and the critical role of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and edge networks in enhancing performance.

                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    When a user wants to access a website like Google.com, a series of steps occur to establish a connection and retrieve the webpage. Here’s a simplified overview:
                </p>
                <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                    <li>
                        <strong>User Input</strong>: The user types "www.google.com" into their browser and presses Enter. The browser initiates a request to fetch the webpage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>DNS Resolution</strong>: The browser needs the IP address of Google.com. It queries a Domain Name System (DNS) resolver (often provided by the user’s ISP or services like Google’s 8.8.8.8). The resolver recursively queries DNS servers (root, TLD, and authoritative servers) to resolve "www.google.com" to an IP address, such as 142.250.190.78.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Connection Initiation</strong>: The user’s device (client) sends a TCP SYN packet to the resolved IP address on port 443 (for HTTPS). This begins a TCP handshake to establish a secure connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Routing to Destination</strong>: The request packet travels through the user’s local network (e.g., home Wi-Fi router) to the Internet Service Provider (ISP). The ISP forwards the packet through its network and peers with other networks until it reaches Google’s servers. This process is governed by routing protocols (detailed in the next section).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Server Response</strong>: Google’s server responds with a TCP SYN-ACK, completing the handshake. The browser then sends an HTTP/HTTPS GET request, and the server returns the webpage’s HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rendering</strong>: The browser renders the webpage, fetching additional resources (e.g., images, fonts) as needed, each following a similar connection process.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <section id="routing-process" class="mb-12">
                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Routing Process</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network for forwarding data packets from source to destination. It involves routers, routing protocols, and routing tables. Here’s how it works:
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Key Components</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Routers</strong>: Devices that forward packets between networks based on IP addresses. Routers maintain routing tables that map destination networks to next-hop addresses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Routing Protocols</strong>: Algorithms that routers use to exchange information and build routing tables. Common protocols include:
                        <ul class="list-circle pl-6 mt-1">
                            <li><strong>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)</strong>: Used between autonomous systems (e.g., ISPs) to exchange routing information across the internet.</li>
                            <li><strong>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)</strong>: Used within a single network to find the shortest path based on link costs.</li>
                            <li><strong>RIP (Routing Information Protocol)</strong>: A simpler protocol for smaller networks, based on hop count.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Routing Tables</strong>: Databases in routers that store paths to network destinations, including next-hop addresses and metrics (e.g., hop count, bandwidth).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Routing in Action</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Continuing with the Google.com example:
                </p>
                <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                    <li>
                        The user’s packet leaves their device with a destination IP (e.g., 142.250.190.78) and enters the local router (e.g., home Wi-Fi router).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The local router forwards the packet to the ISP’s gateway router, which uses its routing table to determine the next hop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The packet travels through multiple routers across ISPs and backbone networks. Each router examines the destination IP, consults its routing table, and forwards the packet to the next hop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        BGP plays a critical role in inter-ISP routing, as it selects paths based on policies, path length, and peering agreements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eventually, the packet reaches Google’s network (an autonomous system), where internal routing (e.g., OSPF) directs it to the appropriate server.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Edge Networks</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    CDNs and edge networks optimize content delivery by bringing data closer to users, reducing latency and improving performance. They are integral to modern internet infrastructure.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">What is a CDN?</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    A Content Delivery Network is a distributed system of servers (points of presence, or PoPs) that cache content closer to users. CDNs serve static assets (e.g., images, videos, scripts) and dynamic content, offloading traffic from origin servers.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">How CDNs Work</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Content Caching</strong>: Websites like Google.com use CDNs (e.g., Akamai, Cloudflare) to cache content on edge servers worldwide. When a user requests Google.com, the CDN’s DNS resolver directs them to the nearest PoP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reduced Latency</strong>: By serving content from a nearby edge server (e.g., in the user’s city), CDNs minimize the distance packets travel, reducing latency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Load Balancing</strong>: CDNs distribute traffic across multiple servers, preventing overload and improving reliability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Security</strong>: CDNs offer DDoS protection, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and TLS encryption, enhancing security.
