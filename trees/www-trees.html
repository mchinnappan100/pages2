        <p>
          Trees are among the most essential living beings on our planet. They serve as natural guardians against 
          strong winds and hurricanes, acting as windbreaks that reduce the velocity of powerful gusts. Their sturdy 
          trunks and dense foliage help protect soil from erosion and reduce damage to nearby homes and farmlands. 
          In coastal regions, mangrove trees form natural barriers that absorb the energy of storm surges, saving 
          countless lives and ecosystems.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-300 mb-2">How Trees Help Each Other – The Wood Wide Web</h2>
        <p>
          Beneath the forest floor lies an incredible hidden world called the 
          <span class="text-green-400 font-medium">“Wood Wide Web.”</span> 
          This underground network of tree roots intertwined with fungi (mycorrhizae) allows trees to 
          communicate and share resources with one another. Through this system, trees exchange water, 
          nutrients, and even warning signals when they are under attack by pests or disease.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Older, stronger trees—often called <span class="text-green-400 font-medium">“mother trees”</span>—
          nurture young saplings by transferring carbon and nitrogen through the fungal threads. 
          This silent cooperation ensures the survival of weaker or shaded trees, maintaining the 
          balance and diversity of the entire forest ecosystem. The Wood Wide Web shows that forests 
          are not just groups of individual trees, but vast, interconnected communities that thrive 
          through communication and mutual support.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-300 mb-2">King Ashoka’s Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Centuries ago, the great Indian Emperor <span class="text-green-400 font-medium">Ashoka the Great</span> 
          demonstrated his compassion not only for people but also for nature. He ordered the planting of 
          <span class="text-green-400 font-medium">fruit-bearing trees</span> along the roads to provide 
          shade and nourishment to travelers and animals alike. His vision for sustainable living and 
          environmental harmony remains a timeless lesson in ecological wisdom.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-300 mb-2">Fruits and Lumber Yields</h2>
        <p>
          Trees offer countless gifts — from delicious fruits that sustain life to valuable timber that 
          supports our industries. Responsible forestry ensures that while we use the lumber, we also 
          replenish what we take. A single fruit tree can feed generations, and a well-managed forest 
          can sustain entire communities for centuries.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-300 mb-2">Trees and the Environment</h2>
        <p>
          Trees are the lungs of the Earth. They absorb carbon dioxide, release oxygen, filter pollutants, 
          and regulate temperature. Forests provide habitat for millions of species and maintain the balance 
          of our ecosystem. Every tree we plant today contributes to a cleaner, cooler, and more sustainable planet.
