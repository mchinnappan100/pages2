Tree of Heaven,Ailanthus altissima,Simaroubaceae,"Highly invasive; spreads aggressively via seeds and root sprouts; releases allelopathic chemicals that suppress native plants; foul odor; weak wood prone to breakage; host for spotted lanternfly",3-9,60-80 feet,40-60 feet,Full sun to shade,"Tolerates poor, dry, compacted soil",Very fast,High,China and Taiwan,"Banned or restricted in many states; do not plant under any circumstances"
Bradford Pear,Callery Pear Pyrus calleryana 'Bradford',Rosaceae,"Invasive escapee from cultivars; weak branch structure leads to storm damage; foul-smelling flowers; thorny wild forms; overplanted and ecologically useless",5-9,30-50 feet,20-35 feet,Full sun,"Adaptable, including clay",Fast,High,East Asia,"All Callery pear cultivars can cross-pollinate and produce invasive seedlings"
Silver Maple,Acer saccharinum,Sapindaceae,"Weak wood and shallow roots cause sidewalk heaving and frequent branch failure; short-lived; aggressive surface roots; pest magnet (aphids, scale)",3-9,50-80 feet,35-60 feet,Full sun to part shade,"Moist to wet, adaptable",Very fast,Low (but problematic),Eastern North America,"Native but ecologically and structurally problematic in urban settings"
