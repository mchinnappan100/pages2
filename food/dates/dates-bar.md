### 🧑‍🍳 **Instructions**

1. **Prepare the Dates**

   * If your dates are firm, soak them in **warm water for 10 minutes**, then drain.
   * This makes them easier to blend and helps form a smooth base.

3. **Add Dates and Rest**

   * Add **dates**, **nut butter**, **oats**, **seeds**, **cocoa powder**, **vanilla**, and **salt**.
   * Pulse until the mixture forms a **sticky dough** that holds when pressed together.

4. **Form Bars**

   * Line a small **baking dish or tray** with parchment paper.
   * Press the mixture firmly and evenly into the pan (use a spatula or your hands).

5. **Chill**

   * Refrigerate for at least **1 hour** to firm up.
