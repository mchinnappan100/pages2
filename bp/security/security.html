    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-200">Introduction: Why Salesforce Security Matters More Than Ever</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
        As enterprises expand their Salesforce footprint, the platform becomes tightly woven into their operational backbone—from sales and finance to customer experience and field operations. 
        This increased centralization makes Salesforce data security not merely an IT concern but a fundamental business priority. 
        Recent breaches at major organizations reveal a stark truth: attackers are no longer exploiting technical vulnerabilities alone. 
        They are increasingly targeting users, behaviors, and overlooked governance processes.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
        Modern security is not just about strong passwords, MFA, or technically sound configurations. 
        It is about establishing a proactive culture that anticipates threats, standardizes secure decision-making, and aligns business teams with platform architects.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-200">A Shifting Threat Landscape</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
        The rise of generative AI has enabled attackers to craft highly convincing phishing and social-engineering campaigns. 
        Salesforce administrators, developers, and business owners may receive requests or install tools that look legitimate but are designed to harvest credentials or exfiltrate data.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
        These attacks often bypass technical safeguards entirely. 
        The weak link isn’t the platform—it’s the human layer.  
        This new reality demands that organizations elevate the maturity of governance, review processes, training, and cross-team communication.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-200">The Enterprise Security Council: A Foundation for Resilient Governance</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
        A central recommendation is the creation of a dedicated, cross-functional 
        <span class="font-semibold text-blue-300">Enterprise Security Council</span>. 
        This team acts as the gatekeeper and steward of secure practices across all Salesforce initiatives.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-100 mt-6">Recommended Roles</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 text-gray-300 space-y-1">
        <li>Salesforce Platform Owner / Architect</li>
        <li>Business Unit Leaders</li>
        <li>Scrum Masters / Project Managers</li>
        <li>Data Privacy, Legal, or Compliance (as needed)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-100 mt-6">Key Responsibilities</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Evaluating architectural decisions that impact access, sharing, or integrations.</li>
        <li>Defining and enforcing authentication & authorization standards across orgs.</li>
        <li>Approving data-sharing patterns for sensitive or regulated fields (PII, financial data, etc.).</li>
        <li>Tracking cross-project risk and ensuring that teams adhere to governance guidelines.</li>
        <li>Establishing clear cybersecurity education and onboarding resources.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
        The council ensures that security is neither a last-minute add-on nor a blocker. 
        Instead, it becomes a structured, collaborative process integrated into every phase of development.

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
        While governance brings enormous value, many organizations struggle with its perception and implementation. 
        The article outlines three recurring challenges:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-decimal list-inside mt-3 text-gray-300 space-y-3">
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Misalignment with Agile delivery:</span>  
          Security reviews often seem slow or incompatible with sprint timelines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Lack of visibility and recognition:</span>  
          Teams may feel that governance work isn’t valued because its success is invisible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Perception of bureaucracy:</span>  
          Without clear communication, governance is seen as red tape instead of protection.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-200">Strategies for Building a Proactive Security Culture</h2>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-100 mt-6">Strategic Approaches</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Secure executive sponsorship to position security as a business priority.</li>
        <li>Promote governance as a collaborative partner, not a bottleneck.</li>
        <li>Establish recurring audits and design reviews as a normalized business process.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-100 mt-6">Tactical Approaches</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Include lightweight security checkpoints in every sprint cycle.</li>
        <li>Use Salesforce-configured custom objects to track decisions, risks, and approvals.</li>
        <li>Maintain a living, digital standards library accessible to all team members.</li>
        <li>Assign story points for governance participation to make contributions visible.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
        When implemented effectively, these actions help teams innovate quickly while maintaining a rigorous security posture.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-200">Conclusion: Security Is a Shared Responsibility</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">
        Salesforce security is not purely a technical discipline—it is a holistic, organization-wide mindset. 
        Tools and platform controls matter greatly, but the real strength lies in how people, processes, and governance 
        come together. A strong Enterprise Security Council, continuous training, and collaborative design reviews 
        ensure that teams can scale securely without sacrificing speed or innovation.
