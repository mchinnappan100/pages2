        including sweet bell peppers and hot chili peppers. They are native to Central and South America and 
        have become staples in cuisines around the world for their vibrant colors, crisp texture, and spicy kick.

    <!-- Growing Peppers -->
    <section class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-lg">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-3">🌱 Growing Peppers</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Peppers thrive in warm climates and need consistent sunlight and heat to flourish. They are perfect for 
        home gardens and can also grow well in containers.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Well-drained, fertile soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Requires at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep soil evenly moist but avoid overwatering; peppers dislike “wet feet.”</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Optimal growing temperature is 70–85°F (21–29°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer and avoid too much nitrogen, which promotes leaves over fruit.</li>
        <li><strong>Harvest:</strong> Harvest when fruits reach full size and color. Peppers can be eaten at any stage of ripeness.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Pollination -->
    <section class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-lg">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-3">🌼 Pollination</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Peppers are **self-pollinating** plants, though they also benefit from insect activity such as bees that help shake the pollen loose. 
        Cross-pollination can occur between hot and sweet varieties if planted nearby, which may affect seed characteristics.
