      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Chia seeds (<em>Salvia hispanica</em>) are small black or white seeds native to Central and South America. 
        They were a staple food of the ancient Aztecs and Mayans, prized for their energy-boosting and nutritional properties. 
        Despite their tiny size, chia seeds are packed with nutrients, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids, earning them the title of a modern “superfood.”

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-3">🌱 Growing Chia</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Chia is an easy-to-grow plant that thrives in warm, sunny conditions and well-drained soil. 
        It grows quickly and can be cultivated both in gardens and in pots.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Prefers sandy or loamy soil with good drainage.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Requires full sun — at least 6 hours per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Moderate watering; avoid overwatering as chia dislikes soggy soil.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Grows best in temperatures between 60–85°F (15–29°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep and 12–18 inches apart.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-3">🌼 Pollination</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Chia plants are **self-pollinating** but also benefit from **insect pollinators** like bees. 
        They produce small purple or white flowers that attract beneficial pollinators, helping increase seed yield.
