        Cauliflower (<em>Brassica oleracea</em> var. <em>botrytis</em>) is a cruciferous vegetable belonging to the same family as broccoli, kale, and cabbage.
        It’s known for its dense, white head called a “curd,” surrounded by green leaves. Cauliflower is highly versatile — 
        it can be eaten raw, steamed, roasted, or used as a low-carb substitute for rice, pizza crust, and mashed potatoes.

    <!-- Growing Cauliflower -->
    <section class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-lg">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-amber-300 mb-3">🌱 Growing Cauliflower</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Cauliflower is a cool-season crop that requires steady moisture and rich soil. It’s a bit more challenging to grow than other brassicas, 
        but with proper care, it rewards gardeners with beautiful white heads.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Fertile, well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0–7.0.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Needs full sun for optimal growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep soil evenly moist but not waterlogged.</li>
        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 18–24 inches apart to allow head formation.</li>
        <li><strong>Blanching:</strong> Tie outer leaves over the developing head to protect it from sunlight and maintain its white color.</li>
        <li><strong>Harvest:</strong> Pick when heads are compact, firm, and white before they begin to separate.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Pollination -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-amber-300 mb-3">🌼 Pollination</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Cauliflower is a **biennial** plant that produces flowers and seeds in its second year. 
        It is **cross-pollinated by insects**, primarily bees, so if you plan to save seeds, 
        make sure to isolate cauliflower from other members of the Brassica family (like broccoli or cabbage) 
        to maintain genetic purity.
