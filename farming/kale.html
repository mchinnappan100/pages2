        Kale (<em>Brassica oleracea</em> var. <em>sabellica</em>) is a leafy green vegetable belonging to the cabbage family. 
        Known for its vibrant green (and sometimes purple) leaves, kale is celebrated as one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet. 
        It’s a hardy, cool-weather crop often grown for its edible leaves, which can be eaten raw or cooked.

    <section class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-lg">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-400 mb-3">🌱 Growing Kale</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Kale is a resilient and easy-to-grow crop that thrives in cooler weather. It can tolerate frost and even tastes sweeter after a light freeze.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Prefers full sun (6+ hours daily) but tolerates partial shade.</li>
        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep soil consistently moist, especially in warm weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants about 12–18 inches apart for optimal growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Harvest:</strong> Begin picking the lower leaves once the plant reaches 8–10 inches tall.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Pollination -->
    <section class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-lg">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-400 mb-3">🌼 Pollination</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Kale is a <strong>biennial</strong> plant that flowers and produces seeds in its second year. 
        It relies on <b>insect pollination</b>, primarily by bees. If you’re saving seeds, ensure isolation 
        from other brassicas to prevent cross-pollination.
