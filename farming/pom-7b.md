## 🏡 **Planting Tips for Zone 7b**

### 🌞 **Site selection**

* Choose a **south-facing wall** or **protected microclimate** (such as near a brick wall or fence that absorbs heat).
* Full sun — at least **6+ hours daily**.

### 🌱 **Soil**

* Well-drained, loamy or sandy soil.
* pH between **5.5 and 7.0**.

### 💧 **Watering**

* Deep watering every **7–10 days** during dry months.
* Avoid soggy roots — they hate standing water.

## 🧊 **Winter Protection Plan**

Zone 7b winters can still be risky for pomegranates. Protect your plant like this:

### 🌾 **Mulch**

* Apply **4–6 inches** of mulch (straw, leaves, or wood chips) around the base.
* Keep mulch slightly away from the trunk.

### 🧣 **Wrap or Cover**

* Wrap young trees with **burlap** or **frost cloth** during freezes.
* You can also build a temporary frame (PVC or wood) and cover it with plastic sheeting.

### ✂️ **Pruning**

* Do **not prune in fall/winter** — new growth is tender and frost-sensitive.
* Wait until **spring** after the risk of frost has passed.

## 🪴 **Container Option (Safer)**

If your winters are unpredictable:

* Grow in a **large container (15–25 gallons)**.
* Move indoors (garage or basement) once temps drop below **25°F (-4°C)**.
* Dwarf types like **‘Nana’** are ideal for this.
