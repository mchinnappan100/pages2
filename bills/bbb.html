                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The "Big Beautiful Bill," officially known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA), is a significant legislative package championed by President Donald Trump during his second term. It recently passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate by narrow margins and is now headed to the President's desk to be signed into law. This comprehensive bill is designed to implement a wide range of Republican priorities, impacting various sectors of American life.

                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            The bill makes permanent many of the individual and business tax cuts from Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which were set to expire. It also introduces new temporary tax breaks, such as allowing workers to deduct tips and overtime pay, and a $6,000 deduction for many older adults. Overall, it contains an estimated $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over ten years.

                            To partially offset the tax cuts, the OBBBA includes significant spending reductions, primarily targeting Medicaid and food assistance programs. These cuts involve new work requirements for some recipients, stricter sign-up rules, and lower federal reimbursements to states.

                            A substantial portion of the bill, around $350 billion, is allocated to border security and Trump's immigration agenda. This includes funding for building more border wall, hiring new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, and increasing the capacity for migrant detention and deportation. New fees for immigrants seeking asylum or employment authorization are also introduced.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The OBBBA's passage has been marked by intense debate and political maneuvering. Republicans utilized the budget reconciliation process to pass the bill, allowing them to circumvent the Senate's filibuster rule and pass it with a simple majority. Despite this, the bill faced significant internal opposition within the Republican party from both moderates concerned about the social safety net cuts and fiscal conservatives worried about the national debt.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Democrats have been unified in their opposition, labeling the bill a "tax giveaway to the rich paid for on the backs of the working class and most vulnerable." They have highlighted analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) which estimate the bill will add trillions to the deficit and lead to millions losing health coverage.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The "Big Beautiful Bill" represents a major legislative victory for President Trump, aiming to solidify his policy agenda in his second term. Its long-term economic and social impacts are expected to be substantial.
