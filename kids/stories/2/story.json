  "title": "The Thirsty Crow",
  "story": "Once upon a time, a black crow was very thirsty. He flew here and there looking for water. At last, he saw a pot with a little water at the bottom. The crow tried to drink, but his beak could not reach the water. Then he had an idea. He dropped small stones into the pot one by one. Slowly, the water rose up. The crow drank the water happily and flew away."
