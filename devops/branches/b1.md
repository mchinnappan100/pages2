**Yes, using the `main` branch (or `master`) for production deployments is not only common — it's considered one of the best practices** in modern Salesforce DevOps (2024–2025).

### Current Industry Consensus (Salesforce DevOps in 2025)
The **main branch** almost always represents:

- The **source of truth** for production-ready code/metadata
- What **should** or **has been** deployed to production
- The most stable and releasable version of your codebase

Most respected sources and communities agree on this point:

| Branching Model              | Main/Master represents                  | Deploy from main to Production? | Recommended for Salesforce?     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GitHub Flow (most popular)   | Production-ready code                   | Yes (often continuously)        | Yes – very common & recommended |
| Trunk-based development      | Always deployable production state      | Yes                             | Yes – modern & fast teams       |
| Simple Feature Branch model  | Production code                         | Yes                             | Yes – especially small/medium teams |
| GitFlow (classic)            | Production releases (stable)            | Yes                             | Sometimes (larger/regulated teams) |
| Environment = Branch         | Production branch = main                | Yes                             | Sometimes (but not ideal)       |

### Most Common & Recommended Patterns Today

1. **Main = Production (most teams in 2025)**  
   - Feature branches → Pull Request → merge to `main`  
   - `main` → automatic deploy to **staging / QA**  
   - After validation → manual or automatic deploy from `main` → **production**  
   → This is the **simplest, fastest, and most widely recommended** pattern today (Gearset, Salesforce Ben, DevOps Launchpad, Trailhead GitHub Flow)

2. **Main + Release branches (very common variation)**  
   - Develop on feature branches → merge to `main` (integration/staging)  
   - When ready to release → create `release/xxx` from `main`  
   - Final testing + bug fixes happen on release branch  
   - Deploy release branch → production  
   - Merge release back to `main` (and usually to develop if you have it)  
   → Still keeps `main` very close to production state

3. **Hotfix flow** (everyone needs this)  
   - Urgent production fix → branch from `main` → `hotfix/xxx`  
   - Deploy → production  
   - Merge back to `main` (and usually to other long-lived branches)

### Quick Decision Table – Which pattern should you use?

Your team size / release style          | Recommended strategy                  | Deploy from main to Prod?
---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------
Small–medium team, frequent releases   | GitHub Flow / Trunk-based              | **Yes** (very often)
Larger team, monthly/quarterly releases| GitFlow or Main + release branches     | **Yes** (after release branch)
Very strict compliance / many envs     | Main + release/hotfix + environment branches | Usually yes
Very mature continuous deployment      | Pure trunk-based                       | **Always**

**Bottom line (2025 best practice summary)**  
Yes — **you should use the `main` branch as the source for production deployments** in the vast majority of real-world Salesforce projects.

It's the cleanest way to achieve:
- Clear audit trail
- Easy rollback (deploy previous main commit)
- Reliable automation
- Maximum alignment with modern DevOps thinking

Just make sure you have good **quality gates** before anything reaches `main` (PR reviews + automated tests + validation deploys to staging/full sandbox).
