## **🎵 “Shell on the Range (Unix Legends Edition)”**

**(Verse 1)**
I was raised on a backroad server,
Where the long nights hum and sing,
Daddy taught me `ls -la`
’Fore I learned to wear this ring.
While the others played with Windows,
I was pipin’ dreams all day,
`grep`-ing through the memories
I stored in my home way.

**(Chorus)**
’Cause I’m livin’ that Unix life,
Where the shell cuts clean like a knife.
Got my boots in the `/root`, my heart in `/usr/local/bin`,
And a prompt that keeps me right.
Yeah the kernel’s strong, and I ride along
Through the logs and the midnight rain…
I’m just a cowboy coder singin’ songs,
With my **shell on the range**.

### **(Verse 2 — Enter the Founding Fathers)**

Now let me tell you ’bout two heroes
From the labs where legends roam:
Old **Ken Thompson** built the trailhead,
Carved the system’s very home.
And **Dennis Ritchie**, ridin’ shotgun,
Wrote the language tough and true—
Without that cowboy and his C,
There'd be no shells for me and you.

They branded Unix like cattle,
Burned their wisdom in the code,
Set the standard for the prairies
Where all our processes rode.
So when I type into this terminal,
Under that wide night sky,
I swear I hear their spurs a-jinglin’
Every time my commands fly by.

**(Chorus)**
Yeah I’m livin’ that Unix life,
Where the shell cuts clean like a knife.
Got my boots in the `/root`, my heart in `/usr/local/bin`,
And a prompt that keeps me right.
From the Bell Labs plains where the greats began
To the servers that keep us sane—
I’m just a cowboy coder singin’ songs,
With my **shell on the range**.

### **(Bridge)**

Some folks fear the man page,
But honey, not me and you—
We scroll those roads like highways,
`less` troubadour than true.
And when we’re feelin’ lost a bit,
`pwd` brings us home,
’Cause Unix ain’t just an OS,
It’s the land where we belong.

---

### **(Final Chorus)**

Yeah I’m livin’ that Unix life,
With Ken and Dennis ridin’ beside.
Where the uptime’s long and the code is strong
And the logs roll like the rain.
Through syscalls, dreams, and wild `cron` jobs,
I’m still on that uptime train—
Forever hummin’ this country song,
With my **shell on the range**.
