## K. Kamaraj: The Uncrowned Kingmaker of Tamil Nadu

**Kumaraswami Kamaraj**, fondly known as **Kamarajar** or "**Karmaveerar**" (the hero of labor), was a towering figure in the political landscape of Tamil Nadu and India. Born on July 15, 1903, in a humble family in Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu, his life journey was marked by selfless service, unwavering commitment to social justice, and a profound dedication to the upliftment of the downtrodden. Despite limited formal education, Kamaraj rose through the ranks of the Indian National Congress to become a powerful statesman, playing a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of post-independence India.

### Early Life and Entry into Politics

Kamaraj's early life was fraught with challenges. He had to discontinue his formal education at a young age to support his family after his father's demise. However, his innate curiosity and keen interest in public affairs drew him towards the Indian independence movement. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 proved to be a turning point in his life, igniting a strong sense of patriotism and a desire to fight against British rule.

Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's call for non-cooperation, Kamaraj plunged into the freedom struggle at the young age of 18. He actively participated in organizing public meetings, propagating the ideals of the Congress party in villages, and raising funds for the movement. His dedication and organizational skills soon caught the attention of S. Satyamurthy, a prominent leader of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, who became his political mentor.

Kamaraj's involvement in the Salt Satyagraha in 1930 led to his first imprisonment, marking the beginning of numerous stints in British jails for his participation in various protests and agitations. These experiences further solidified his resolve and provided him with opportunities to interact with other nationalist leaders, broadening his political perspective.

### Ascendancy in Tamil Nadu Politics

In 1940, Kamaraj was elected President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, a position he held until 1954. His leadership was instrumental in strengthening the party's organizational structure at the grassroots level. He was known for his ability to connect with the common people, understand their needs, and mobilize them for the national cause.

Following India's independence in 1947, Kamaraj focused his efforts on the development of Tamil Nadu. He became the Chief Minister of Madras State (now Tamil Nadu) in 1954 and served in this capacity for three consecutive terms until 1963. His tenure as Chief Minister is widely regarded as a golden era for Tamil Nadu, marked by significant progress in various sectors, particularly education and infrastructure.

### Champion of Education and Social Justice

Kamaraj firmly believed that education was the key to social and economic progress. Despite his own limited schooling, he prioritized expanding access to education for all, especially the marginalized sections of society. Some of his landmark initiatives in education include:

* **Free and Compulsory Education:** He implemented free and compulsory education up to the secondary school level, ensuring that poverty was not a barrier to learning.
* **Expansion of Schools:** Thousands of new schools were established across the state, even in remote villages, to make education accessible to all children. The number of primary schools nearly doubled during his tenure.
* **Midday Meal Scheme:** This pioneering scheme, initially introduced in Chennai and later extended state-wide, provided free nutritious meals to schoolchildren. This initiative not only improved the nutritional status of children but also significantly increased school enrollment and reduced dropout rates. Kamaraj understood that hunger was a major impediment to education, and this scheme addressed that fundamental issue.
* **Free Uniforms:** To eliminate disparities and encourage all children to attend school with dignity, free uniforms were provided to students.

These educational reforms earned him the affectionate title of "**Kalvi Thanthai**" (Father of Education) of Tamil Nadu. His policies led to a remarkable increase in the literacy rate of the state.

Beyond education, Kamaraj's administration also focused on social justice. He worked towards the upliftment of backward communities and implemented measures to reduce caste discrimination. His humble background and deep understanding of social inequalities fueled his commitment to creating a more equitable society.

### The "Kingmaker" in National Politics

Kamaraj's influence extended far beyond the borders of Tamil Nadu. His political acumen and organizational skills were highly respected at the national level. After the death of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1964, Kamaraj played a crucial role in the selection of Lal Bahadur Shastri as the next Prime Minister. Similarly, after Shastri's sudden demise, Kamaraj was instrumental in Indira Gandhi becoming the Prime Minister in 1966, earning him the moniker "**Kingmaker**" in Indian politics. He twice declined the post of Prime Minister himself, prioritizing party unity and stability.

### The Kamaraj Plan

In 1963, Kamaraj proposed a bold and innovative strategy known as the "**Kamaraj Plan**" to revitalize the Congress party. He suggested that senior Congress leaders should resign from their ministerial posts to dedicate themselves to party organizational work. This selfless move was aimed at dispelling the allure of power among party members and injecting fresh energy into the party machinery. Several prominent leaders, including Kamaraj himself, resigned under this plan, setting an example of dedication to the party's objectives.

### Later Life and Legacy

Kamaraj served as the President of the Indian National Congress from 1964 to 1967. Despite facing political setbacks later in his career, his commitment to public service remained unwavering. He continued to work for the welfare of the people until his death on October 2, 1975.

K. Kamaraj's legacy is that of a simple, honest, and dedicated leader who rose from humble beginnings to become a pivotal figure in Indian politics. His contributions to education, social justice, and national leadership continue to inspire generations. He is remembered for his pragmatism, integrity, and unwavering focus on the welfare of the common person. In 1976, he was posthumously awarded the **Bharat Ratna**, India's highest civilian award, in recognition of his exceptional service to the nation. His life stands as a testament to the power of selfless leadership and its transformative impact on society.
