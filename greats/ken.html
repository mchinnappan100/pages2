      <p>
        Ken Thompson's work has profoundly shaped modern computing. Unix and its derivatives (Linux, macOS) form the backbone of many systems. 
        Go (Golang) is now widely used for cloud services, networking, and scalable software. His innovations in programming languages, system design, and security continue to influence developers and computer scientists globally.
